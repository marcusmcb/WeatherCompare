# WeatherCompare

Welcome to the WeatherCompare app!

WeatherCompare is a simple travel and weather app that allows you to compare the weather where you are currently to where you will be travelling to later in the day.

### Using WeatherCompare

Using the app is very straight-forward.  After signing in, simply enter your current location as well as your destination and specify the dates on which you will be travelling.  WeatherCompare will then take the information that you've submitted and run a comparison to between the two locations for the dates specified.  In the results you will see a comparison between your two locations:

* Temperature
* Humidity
* Wind speed

Once you have your comparison you then have the option to run a new comparison if you like or search for points of interest in the vicinity of your destination.

### About the app:

WeatherCompare was built as my first group project assignment in my coding bootcamp at UC Irvine.  The technologies involved include:

* Bootstrap CSS
* Javascript / jQuery
* Firebase (for sign-in/authentication)

I was primarily responsible for designing the layout and look of the front-end for this project.
